Here is the context for the story:

There is a foolish monkey that lives in the tree and a shark that lives in the sea. The shark's sultan is sick and wants to eat a heart to regain health. In a separate world, there is a hare that works for a lion. The lion is sick and wants to eat a heart to get better. The hare notices that there is a donkey right outside in the forest. The hare secretly wants the heart for itself.
