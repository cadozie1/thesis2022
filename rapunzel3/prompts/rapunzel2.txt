Here is the context for the story:



Rapunzel is a young, blonde girl who grew up in a tower. Her father left her to an evil enchantress as punishment for stealing the enchantress's flower for Rapunzel's mother. On the other side of the kingdom, there is a prince in a castle. The king has a ladder in storage. Rapunzel wants to leave the tower that she grew up in and go to the forest. Rapunzel's mother and father want to go to the tower their daughter grew up in, while the mother has the ladder. The king and enchantress both want to visit the garden. This story is not like the traiditional Rapunzel story.
