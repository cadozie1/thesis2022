Here is the context for the story:

Ki wu and Pao shu are two young men who love to work hard. Ki wu and Pao shu are very good friends and many people talk of their bounteous virtue. One day Ki wu and Pao shu are tired after working a long time. The pathway happens to reward those who are virtuous with precious golden nuggets and those who are not with deadly, dangerous snakes. There is also a countryman who is not virtuous lounging lazily at the spring. To get to the spring from the city, you have to first go to the grove, then to the stream, then to the pathway, and then you arrive at the spring. To be able to rest, there should be no one else resting there. Ki wu and will end up losing his virtuousness eventually. Pao shu and Ki wu will surely end up at the grove. The countryman will no longer be resting after a long nap and will end up travelling to the city.
