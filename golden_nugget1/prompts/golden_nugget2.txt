Here is the context for the story:

Ki wu and Pao shu are two young men who love to work hard. Ki wu and Pao shu are very good friends and many people talk of their bounteous virtue. One day Ki wu and Pao shu are tired after working a long time, so they decide to go look for the wonderous spring to rest. The pathway happens to reward those who are virtuous with precious golden nuggets and those who are not with deadly, dangerous snakes. There is also a countryman who is not virtuous lounging lazily at the spring. To get to the spring from the city, you have to first go to the grove, then to the stream, then to the pathway, and then you arrive at the spring. To be able to rest, there should be no one else resting there. Ki wu and Pao shu hope to remain virtuuos. Pao shu and Ki wu want to end up at the pathway and no longer be tired. Kiwu and Pao shu should end up with gold nuggets.
