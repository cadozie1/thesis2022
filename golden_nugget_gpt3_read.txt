Ki wu and Pao shu are two young men. 
Ki wu and Pao su are very good friends and many people told of their virtue. 
One day Ki wu and Pao shu are tired after working a long time, so they decide to go look for the spring to rest. 
The pathway happens to reward those who are virtuous with golden nuggets and those who are not with deadly snakes. 
There is also a countryman laying at the spring.
To get to the spring from the city, you have to first go to the grove, then to the stream, then to the pathway, and then you arrive at the spring.
To be able to rest, there should be no one else resting there.
