Here is the context for the story:

Rapunzel is a young, blonde girl who grew up in a tall tower isolated from the rest of the world. Her father left her to an evil enchantress as punishment for stealing the enchantress's flower for Rapunzel's motehr. On the other side of the kingdom, there is a handsome, dashing prince in a magnificent castle. The king happens to own a ladder among many other assorted items in storage. Rapunzel as of now desires to leave the tower that she has lived her whole life in to go back to her family's house. Rapunzel's mother hopes that one day her hair will grow out really, really long. The enchantress currently despises absolutely everyone and hopes that her hatred for the king will never change. The prince hopes to find true love. This telling of Rapunzel is not like the traditional telling of the tale.
