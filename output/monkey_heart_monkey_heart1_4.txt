The sultan outwits the shark through cunning and deception.
The hare travels from the cave to the forest, with anyone who is accompanying the hare.
The hare outsmarts the donkey by cunningly leading it astray.
The hare uses its cunning to deceive the donkey into thinking it is slower than it actually is.
The donkey slowly plods through the dense forest, its furry coat stained with mud and leaves. Accompanied by the travellers, the donkey carefully makes its way towards the cave entrance. The ground is uneven and slippery, but the donkey is sure-footed, carefully picking its way through the undergrowth.
The lion devours the donkey's heart, which was the result of the donkey being tricked twice.
The sultan and those travelling with him leave the sea and move to the cliff.
As the sultan moves away from the cliff and towards the tree, anyone travelling with him will also accompany him on this journey.
The sultan plays a trick on the monkey by making him think he will receive a reward for doing a simple task, when in reality the sultan has no intention of giving the monkey anything.
