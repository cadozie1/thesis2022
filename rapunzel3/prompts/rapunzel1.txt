Here is the context for the story:

Rapunzel is a girl who grew up in a tower. Her father left her to an enchantress as punishment for stealing the enchantress's flower for Rapunzel's mother. There is a prince in a castle. The king has a ladder. Rapunzel wants to leave the tower and go to the forest. Rapunzel's mother and father want to go to the tower, the mother with the ladder. The king and enchantress want to visit the garden. This story is not like the traiditional Rapunzel story.
