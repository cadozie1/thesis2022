Here is the context for the story:

Rapunzel is a young, blonde girl who grew up in a tower. Her father left her to an evil enchantress as punishment for stealing the enchantress's flower for Rapunzel's mother. On the other side of the kingdom, there is a prince in a castle. The king has a ladder in storage. Rapunzel wants to leave the tower. The prince wants to find true love. This story is not like the traiditional Rapunzel story.
