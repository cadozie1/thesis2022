Here is the context for the story:

There is a lonely monkey that lives in the tree by the cliff and a shark that lives in the sea nearby. The shark's sultan is terribly sick and wants to find a heart to eat in order to regain his health. In a separate world, there is a scheming hare that works for a majestic lion. The lion is unfortunately sick and wants to eat a heart in order to get better. The hare happens to notice that there is a foolish donkey right outside the lion's den in the forest. The hare secretly wants the heart for itself, hoping to gain its restorative powers.
