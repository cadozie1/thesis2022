Here is the context for the story:

Ki wu and Pao shu are two young men who love to spend long hours working hard. Ki wu and Pao su are very good friends and many people talk of their bounteous virtue. One day Ki wu and Pao shu are tired after working for a long time, so they decide to go look for a wonderous place to rest together. The pathway along the way happens to reward those who are virtuous with precious golden nuggets and those who are not with deadly, dangerous snakes. There is also a countryman who is not virtuous lounging lazily at the spring. To get to the spring from the city, you have to first go to the grove, then to the stream, then to the pathway, and then you arrive at the spring. To be able to rest, there should be no one else resting there beforehand. Ki wu will end up losing his virtuousness eventually sometime during the journey. Pao shu and Ki wu will surely end up at the grove at some point. The countryman will no longer be resting at the spring after a nice long nap and will end up travelling far, all the way to the city.
