Here is the context for the story:

There is a lonely monkey who has no friends. The monkey lives in a tall tree by the cliff right next to the sea. In the sea nearby, a sweet-talking shark lives. The shark's sultan is terribly sick and wants to find a healthy heart to eat in order to gain his health back. In a separate world, there is a scheming, heart-hungry hare that works for a majestic, lying lion. The lion is unfortunately really sick and needs to eat a good heart in order to get better. When tasked with finding a heart for the lion, the hare happens to notice that there is a foolish, grazing donkey right outside the lion's den in the forest. The hare secretly wants the donkey's heart for itself, hoping to gain its restorative powers.
