The hare departs the cave and enters the forest, with any companions accompanying the hare.
The hare uses its quick wit to deceive the donkey, leading it astray with false promises.
The hare tells the donkey that he knows a shortcut to the finish line and that the donkey should follow him. The hare then leads the donkey into a field and tells him to wait there while he goes ahead to the finish line. The hare then runs off and leaves the donkey behind.
The donkey slowly makes its way from the forest and towards the cave, with any accompanying travellers. The journey is made in silence, with only the sound of the donkey's hooves on the ground and the occasional rustle of leaves as the group moves through the forest.
The lion eats the donkey's heart after the donkey has been tricked twice. The lion takes advantage of the donkey's gullibility, devouring its heart to show who is really the clever one in this situation.
The sultan and his traveling companions move from the sea to the cliff.
The sultan, accompanied by his retinue, moves from the cliff to the tree.
