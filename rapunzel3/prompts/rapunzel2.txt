Here is the context for the story:

Rapunzel wants to leave the tower and go to the forest. Rapunzel's mother and father want to go to the tower, the mother with the ladder. The king and enchantress want to visit the garden.


Rapunzel is a young, blonde girl who grew up in a tower. Her father left her to an evil enchantress as punishment for stealing the enchantress's flower for Rapunzel's mother. On the other side of the kingdom, there is a prince in a castle. The king has a ladder in storage. Rapunzel wants to leave the tower. The prince wants to find true love. This story is not like the traiditional Rapunzel story.
