Here is the context for the story:

Rapunzel is a young, blonde girl who grew up in a tower. Her father left her to an evil enchantress as punishment for stealing the enchantress's flower for Rapunzel's mother. On the other side of the kingdom, there is a prince in a castle. The king has a ladder in storage. Rapunzel desires to leave the tower and return to her family's house. Rapunzel's mother hopes to grow out her hair one day. The enchantress currently hates absolutely everyone and hopes to still hate the king. The prince hopes to find true love. This story is not like the traiditional Rapunzel story.
