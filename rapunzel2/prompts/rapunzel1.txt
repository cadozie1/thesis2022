Here is the context for the story:

Rapunzel is a girl who grew up in a tower. Her father left her to an enchantress as punishment for stealing the enchantress's flower for Rapunzel's mother. There is a prince in a castle. The king has a ladder. Rapunzel wants to go back to her family's house. Rapuznel's mother hopes to grow out her hair. The enchantress currently hates everyone and hopes to still hate the king. The prince hopes to find true love. This story is not like the traiditional Rapunzel story.
