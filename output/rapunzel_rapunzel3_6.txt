Rapunzel took a knife and cut her own hair.
Rapunzel ties her cut hair into a rope and uses it to lower herself down from the tower.
Rapunzel walks from the tower to the forest. She takes in the fresh air and enjoys the smell of the trees and the earth. She feels the sun on her skin and hears the birds singing. She is happy to be outside and away from her tower.
Rapunzel walks through the forest towards the castle. She admires the trees and the wildlife as she goes, thinking about how lucky she is to be able to live in such a beautiful place. As she nears the castle, she can see it shining in the sun and she can't help but feel excited to be going home.
The prince serenades the crowd with a beautiful song.
Rapunzel flatters the prince with kind words.
Rapunzel and the prince get married and live happily ever after.
The prince strides confidently from the castle gates and into the murky forest beyond.
The prince departs the forest and approaches the tower. He strides confidently across the open meadow, his eyes fixed on the imposing structure ahead of him. With each step he takes, the prince feels his resolve harden; he knows he must rescue the princess from the tower, no matter what the cost.
The enchantress's hair continues to grow, taking years to reach its full length.
The prince slowly made his way up the winding tower, his heart pounding in his chest. The enchantress followed close behind, lending a helping hand when needed. Finally, they reached the top of the tower where the prince could see the whole kingdom laid out before him.
The prince leapt from the tower, leaving behind the only life he had ever known. He tumbled through the air, the ground racing up to meet him. The prince closed his eyes, resigned to his fate.
