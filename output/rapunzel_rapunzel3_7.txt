Rapunzel used her newly cut hair to create a makeshift rope, which she then used to climb down the tower.
Rapunzel left the tower and walked into the forest.
Rapunzel walks through the forest, emerging from the trees at the edge of the castle grounds.
The prince begins to sing, his voice carrying throughout the area and filling everyone with a sense of peace and calm.
Rapunzel uses her charms to convince the prince to do what she wants.
The prince and Rapunzel marry each other and live happily ever after.
The prince takes a leisurely stroll from the castle to the forest, enjoying the fresh air and peaceful scenery.
The prince walks briskly from the forest towards the tower, which looms in the distance. He knows he must hurry; the princess is waiting for him.

The prince slowly made his way up the tower, clutching at the rough edges for support. Every so often he would glance up, wincing at the height above him. Finally, he reached the top and cautiously peeked over the edge.
The prince has no other choice but to jump off the tower.
