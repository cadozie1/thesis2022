Rapunzel gripped the end of her long, flowing hair tightly in her fists and began to lower herself down the side of the tall tower one inch at a time. The sharp edges of the stone cut into her palms as she slid down, but she paid them no mind. Soon, she was close enough to the ground to jump the rest of the way down, and she landed lightly on her feet.

She soon reached the edge of the forest and stopped, looking around her.As Rapunzel walked out of the forest, she could see the castle in the distance. She had been walking for hours, and she was tired, but she knew she had to keep going.

A small smile tugged at the corners of his mouth as he inhaled the crisp, clean scent of the forest and started down the path that would lead him to his ultimate destination.The prince strides through the woods, his gaze fixed upon the imposing tower in the distance. Every crunch of leaves underfoot brings him closer to his destination, and as he nears the tower, he quickens his pace, eager to reach it.
