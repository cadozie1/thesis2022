The sultan uses his cunning to deceive the shark.
The hare leaves the cave and enters the forest, with anyone who is accompanying the hare.
The hare outwits the donkey by fooling it into thinking it can win the race.
The hare tricks the donkey by pretending to be tired and asking the donkey to carry him. The donkey agrees, but when they get to the finish line, the hare jumps off the donkey's back and crosses the finish line first, leaving the donkey behind.
The donkey continues its journey, moving from the forest and into the cave. Anyone travelling with the donkey accompanies it on the rest of the journey.
After the lion devours the rest of the donkey's body, he satisfactionedly nibbles on the donkey's heart, which he had been eying longingly since the beginning of the meal. The lion savors the heart, which is still warm and dripping with blood, as a final token of victory over the foolish creature who had been tricked twice.
The sultan conveyed himself from the water's edge to the cliff face, with all of his attendants in tow.
