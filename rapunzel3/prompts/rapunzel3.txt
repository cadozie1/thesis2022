Here is the context for the story:

Rapunzel is a young, blonde girl who grew up in a tall tower isolated from the rest of the world. Her father left her to an evil enchantress as punishment for stealing the enchantress's flower for Rapunzel's motehr. On the other side of the kingdom, there is a handsome, dashing prince in a magnificent castle. The king happens to own a ladder among many other assorted items in storage. Rapunzel as of now desires to leave the tower that she has lived her whole life in and go to the forest. Rapunzel's mother and father want to go to the tower their daughter grew up in to see what it is like. To do so, they will first ensure that the mother has the ladder. The king and enchantress both want to visit the garden so as to smell the lovely flowers. This telling of Rapunzel is not like the traditional telling of the tale.
