Rapunzel cuts her own hair.
Rapunzel grabs a handful of her long, blonde hair and starts to lower herself down the tower wall, using the hair as a makeshift rope. Her hands shake and she manages to cut her fingers on the jagged edges of the stone as she goes. She's never done anything like this before, and she's terrified that she's going to fall and die. Finally, after what feels like hours, she reaches the bottom of the tower and collapses onto the ground, exhausted.
Rapunzel walks from the tower to the forest. She makes her way through the dense trees, listening to the crunch of leaves below her feet. She feels the warm sun on her skin and the fresh air fill her lungs. As she walks, she looks around at the beautiful nature that surrounds her, taking it all in.
